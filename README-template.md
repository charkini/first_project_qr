### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of responsive design and CSS Flexbox. I learned how to properly center content vertically and horizontally and how to add box-shadow.

```css
body {
    background: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    font-size: 15px;
}

.qr-div {
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    max-width: 320px;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:
CSS Grid for more complex layouts
CSS variables for better maintainability
Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus states)
